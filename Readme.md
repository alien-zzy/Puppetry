# Introduction

Aims to combine the traditional Chinese intangible cultural heritage - shadow puppetry

Using virtual reality (VR) and robotic arm control technology to achieve an immersive interactive experience of "virtual control-reality restoration‚Äù

Through technological means, can make it easier for the younger generation to access and identify with traditional culture and promote the inheritance and innovation of intangible cultural heritage.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alien-zzy/Puppetry.git
cd your-repo

```
## üéÆ Project Features

- üï∂ Ô∏èVR perspective operation: users can freely manipulate shadow puppets in 3D virtual space
- üßç Virtual shadow puppet characters: highly realistic shadow puppet modeling and action binding.
- ü§ñ Robotic arm synchronization: 3 robotic arms drive the physical shadow puppets to move synchronously through control signals.
- üé≠ Metaverse + Intangible Cultural Heritage: explore the integration and innovation of intangible cultural heritage and metaverse.

## üß± Technology Stack

- UnityÔºà3D scenes and interactionsÔºâ
- Oculus / SteamVR SDKÔºàVR ControllÔºâ
- RoArm-M2-S (Rrobot ArmÔºâ
- BlenderÔºàShadow puppet modeling and riggingÔºâ
- C# / PythonÔºàScript control and signal processingÔºâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Robotic Arm Setup

1. **Power on** the robotic arms.
2. Ensure the **robotic arms and your PC are connected to the same local network**.
3. Open the file:**. Puppetry/Python/RoboticArm.py** and set the correct **local IP address** for the robotic arms.
4. Run the Python script to establish the connection:
    ```bash
    python RoboticArm.py
    ```
5. Launch the Unity project and start the main VR scene.

## üß™ Test Environment

The system has been tested under the following environment:

| Component         | Specification                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Unity Version     | Unity 2022.3.47f1                        |
| VR Device         | Oculus Quest 2 + Link  |
| Robotic Arms      | RoArm-M2-S (waveshare)  |
| Control Interface | Python 3.9 + Serial / Socket LAN Control |
| OS                | Windows 10 / 11                          |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please ensure all devices are on the same LAN for real-time synchronization.
